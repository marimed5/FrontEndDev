    <h3>Lobster Thermidor Recipe!</h3>
    <p><b>Lobster:</b> When purchasing filet mignon steaks (about 8-ounces each) from the butcher, keep your eyes peeled for a deep red color that’s free of any silver skin (connective tissue). And check to see if the steaks are soft to the touch when the butcher handles them!
        <br><b>Steak Seasoning:</b> All you need is a generous amount of salt and pepper. The basting butter is what’s going to give your filets enormous amounts of flavor.
        <br><b>Basting Butter:</b> This is a simple combination of unsalted butter, fresh rosemary, and fresh garlic cloves.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cook Lobster Thermidor:</b><br>
        For this recipe, I use a cast iron pan as it helps to get a really good sear on the steaks. If you don’t have cast iron you can use an oven-safe stainless steel pan. Just don’t use a non-stick pan for this recipe!
        Prep the steaks. Remove the steaks from the fridge about 30 to 40 minutes before cooking so that they come to room temperature. Then generously season all sides with salt and pepper. Pat it in good!</p>
